# Spring Boot Application Startup Error Fix

## Issue
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
Error starting ApplicationContext. To display the condition evaluation report re-run your application with 'debug' enabled.
2025-06-12T16:39:15.303+03:00 ERROR 1616 --- [Farm_Sharing] [main] o.s.boot.SpringApplication : Application run failed
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by an incomplete database configuration in the `application.properties` file. The file was using an environment variable `${AIVEN_URL}` for the database connection URL, but:

1. This environment variable might not have been set in the environment where the application was running
2. There were no default values provided as fallbacks
3. The database username and password properties were missing entirely

## Solution
The `application.properties` file was updated to:

1. Provide default values for the database connection URL using the Spring property placeholder syntax: `${AIVEN_URL:default_value}`
2. Add database username and password properties with default values
3. Explicitly specify the driver class name

Here's the updated configuration:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=${AIVEN_URL:jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/farm_sharing}
spring.datasource.username=${AIVEN_USERNAME:postgres}
spring.datasource.password=${AIVEN_PASSWORD:postgres}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
```

This configuration allows the application to:
- Use environment variables if they are set (AIVEN_URL, AIVEN_USERNAME, AIVEN_PASSWORD)
- Fall back to default values (local PostgreSQL database) if the environment variables are not set

## Verification
The fix was verified by running the application tests, which confirmed that the application context can now be loaded successfully.

## Best Practices
1. Always provide default values for critical configuration properties
2. Include all necessary database connection properties (URL, username, password, driver)
3. Use environment variables for sensitive information, but ensure they have sensible defaults for development
